*-----Purpose----------------------------------------------------------|
*
*     Computes exp(t*H), the matrix exponential of a general matrix in
*     full, using the irreducible rational Pade approximation to the 
*     exponential function exp(x) = r(x) = (+/-)( I + 2*(q(x)/p(x)) ),
*     combined with scaling-and-squaring.
*
*-----Arguments--------------------------------------------------------|
*
*     ideg      : (input) the degre of the diagonal Pade to be used.
*                 a value of 6 is generally satisfactory.
*
*     m         : (input) order of H.
*
*     H(ldh,m)  : (input) argument matrix.
*
*     t         : (input) time-scale (can be < 0).
*                  
*     wsp(lwsp) : (workspace/output) lwsp .ge. 4*m*m+ideg+1.
*
*     ipiv(m)   : (workspace)
*
*>>>> iexph     : (output) number such that wsp(iexph) points to exp(tH)
*                 i.e., exp(tH) is located at wsp(iexph ... iexph+m*m-1)
*                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*                 NOTE: if the routine was called with wsp(iptr), 
*                       then exp(tH) will start at wsp(iptr+iexph-1).
*
*     ns        : (output) number of scaling-squaring used.
*
*     iflag     : (output) exit flag.
*                      0 - no problem
*                     <0 - problem
